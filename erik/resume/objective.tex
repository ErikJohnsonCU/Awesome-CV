I have never been satisfied with just attending lectures and doing coursework. I have never been satisfied with just getting average grades. I have only ever worked hard and I will continue working hard. The people around me are what makes everything worth doing so well and I've had some of the best mentors possible with my peers, co-workers, and professors. These mentors have inspired me to give back to my community through organizing workshops, project management, and teaching.
