# Erik Johnson Résumé [![resume](https://img.shields.io/badge/resume-perfect-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/ErikJohnsonCU/Awesome-CV/blob/master/erik/resume.pdf)


This is ecmjohnson's resume! It was made using the fantastic [**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template created by [**posquit0**](https://github.com/posquit0). This LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** was inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv).

## My Résumé

Feel free to check out the résumé I built using this template [PDF](https://github.com/ErikJohnsonCU/Awesome-CV/blob/master/erik/resume.pdf)

## Slow start your own

Highly recommended to start with your own fork of [posqui0's branch](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).
A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)
I would also recommend using a real-time build system like `latexmk` with a continuously updating viewer like Okular.
